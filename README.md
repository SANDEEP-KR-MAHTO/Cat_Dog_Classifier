# 🐶🐱 Cat vs Dog Classifier - Deep Learning Project

This project is an **end-to-end deep learning image classification system** that distinguishes between cats and dogs using **transfer learning** with **MobileNetV2**. It includes everything from data preprocessing and model training to deployment as a live **Streamlit app**.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- ✅ Achieved **95%+ validation accuracy**
- 📦 Used **MobileNetV2** for efficient and fast feature extraction
- 🧠 Fine-tuned model with a small learning rate for improved performance
- 🖼️ Accepts image uploads for real-time prediction
- 🌐 Deployed using **Streamlit**
